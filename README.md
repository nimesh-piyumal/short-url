### API Endpoints

*   **POST /api/shorten**: Accepts a long URL and returns a shortened version.
    
    *   Request body: { "originalUrl": "https://example.com" }
        
    *   Response body: { "shortened": "shortened-string" }

### UI

The frontend provides a form where you can input a long URL, and it will display the shortened version along with a clickable link.
